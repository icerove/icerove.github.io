Bo, my husband, is starting practicing speech skills from today since his manager for now, suggests for improving expression ability for manager level. 
I feel really proud of him since he just has the talk to improve this skill and tonight, he joins a talk-speech club after work. 
He is really such person that knows what he wants and what he should do. Even he is not very skillful for now, I believe he will manage it over time.
The table topic for him today is: what kind of tech do you think will improve human life if it is existing.
His answer is having the effective medicine for COVID-19. I really feel proud and impressive for this answer.
